Netty is composed of three components - buffer, channel, event model

**ChannelHandlerContext is important interface, its function is that enables a channelHandler to interact with
its ChannelPipeline

From FirstNettyServer, we will find a simple httpServer, but I have some questions, like these:
1. we add HttpServerCodec to be first, but in FirstNettyServerHandler1, we cannot get request body, Why?
2. About HttpServerCodec, how to parse "stream"?
3. How to define my own "HttpServerHandler",(HttpRequestHandler, HttpResponseHandler)

**About 1
1. we need to understand the "ChannelRead" method of ByteToMessageDecoder
2. we need to understand the decode method of HttpObjectDecoder
